# TEKNOFEST-2025

TEKNOFEST is Türkiye’s premier and the world’s largest aerospace and technology festival, organized in collaboration with Türkiye’s leading defense industry companies and various institutions.

I was a member of the 2024–2025 Vertical Landing Rocket Team, serving as the Avionics System Team Lead.

I developed a program that includes rocket-related formulas and performs iterative calculations based on user input to support our mechanical team’s analysis.
